                 well before the pandemic, so why havenâ€™t rental websites such\
                 as Airbnb incorporated scam detection into their products? A\
                 team member recently experienced this scenario - the 15\
                 person family arrived at a beautiful Beverly Hills mansion\
                 after having paid a large sum of money, only to find out that\
                 the mansion, in fact, did not exist. While they got their\
                 money back, the situation could have been completely avoided\
                 with proper vetting, and the experience was left wanting. Our\
                 product will take into account several factors such as\
                 listing reviews, host reviews, analysis of pictures and\
                 address verification in order to establish trust and\
                 reliability for the consumer renting on Airbnb.', form=url))
