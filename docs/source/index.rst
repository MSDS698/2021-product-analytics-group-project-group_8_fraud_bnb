=====================================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| Vacation rental scams have been prevalent since well before the pandemic, so why haven’t rental websites such as Airbnb incorporated scam detection into their products? A team member recently experienced this scenario - the 15 person family arrived at a beautiful Beverly Hills mansion after having paid a large sum of money, only to find out that the mansion, in fact, did not exist. While they got their money back, the situation could have been completely avoided with proper vetting, and the experience was left wanting. 
| Our product will take into account several factors such as listing reviews (and time between reviews), host reviews, number of cancellations, analysis of pictures, and address verification in order to establish trust and reliability for the consumer renting on Airbnb. We will calculate a “reliability score” based on those features and showcase that score on our application. Our customer segment is broad - we are targeting anyone who needs to use Airbnb to book a property. This is a useful product for both customers who have already booked, as our app serves as peace of mind, and customers who are yet to book, as they can view an estimated score - about how trustworthy a property is - before booking it.
